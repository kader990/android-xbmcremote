# How to use SoftKeys to Jump-to-Letter in list views #

android-xbmcremote now supports Jump-to-Letter in list views.
By pressing a letter key on the keyboard of your handset (only ascii-lettes: a-z are currently supported) will jump to the next entry starting with that letter in the list.

On Android phones without a hard-keyboard, you will have to bring up the soft-keyboard to use this feature.

The HTC Magic always brings up the soft-keyboard when the menu key is long-pressed.

android-xbmcremote emulates this behaviour for all handsets, so all you have to do in order to bring up the soft-keyboard in a list view is to long-press the menu key on your handset.

Repeatedly pressing the same letter key on the keyboard (hard or soft) will iterate through list entrie starting with that letter.
